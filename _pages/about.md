I am currently working in the [Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu) at Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow under the advisory of [Dr. Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). My work focuses on unsupervised and weakly supervised learning in satellite images. Previously, I held Computer Vision Engineer position in Planet Labs. I earned my **Ph.D**. degree (2011-2016) in the [Chester F. Carlson Center for the Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu) at Rochester Institute of Technology under the advisory of Dr. [Matthew. J. Hoffman](https://people.rit.edu/mjhsma/index.html). My Ph.D. thesis concentrated on utilizing a multi-modal optical sensor to detect and track vehicles from a moving and fixed aerial platform. Before my arrival to RIT, I earned my **Masters** Degree (2011) in the [Electrical & Computer Engineering Department](https://www.bridgeport.edu/academics/schools-colleges/school-engineering/departments/electrical-engineering-department/) at University of Bridgeport. With the advisory of Dr. [Buket Barkana](https://sites.google.com/site/drbuketbarkanaslab/), I conducted research on non-speech environmental sound classification in the Signal Processing Research Group. This work included the design of a new feature set highlighting the range of pitch values of non-speech sounds. Finally, I obtained my **Bachelors** degree (2009) in the [Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department](https://eee.ogu.edu.tr) at Eskisehir Osmangazi University under the advisory of Dr. [Osman Parlaktuna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VpxK5TkAAAAJ&hl=en). My overall research interests lie in the fields of *weakly supervised learning*, *visual object detection and tracking*.
